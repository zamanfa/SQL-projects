1) RestaurantDB

This project analyzes customer behavior at a restaurant using SQL. It focuses on understanding customer visit patterns, total spending, and favorite menu items. By leveraging SQL queries, we extract valuable insights such as the average time between visits, total revenue per customer, and most popular dishes. These insights help improve customer relationships and personalize the dining experience for loyal customers.
